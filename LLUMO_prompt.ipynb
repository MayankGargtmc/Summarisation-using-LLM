By using invertible transformations (gaussian copula), the model is able to capture non-Gaussian output distributions. Experiments with artificial and real data (EEG and climate), highlight the predictive ability of the proposed model. The authors introduce a relatively straightforward extension for Gaussian neural processes in which both mean and (half of the) covariance functions are specified as neural networks, and the covariance function is either explicitly calculated as an inner product in (7) or as a squared exponential covariance function modulated in magnitude by an auxiliary neural network and calculated using the outputs of a neural network rather than the input data itself (x_t, x_c, y_c). Their multi-output and non-Gaussian strategy follows the modulated kernel and Gaussian copula formulation, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on both artificial and real data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over the related, but more computationally expensive, fullConvGNP model. Moreover, on real data, the proposed model outperforms both mean field, convNP and MOGP approximations.\\n\\nSomething that is not discussed in the paper is the setting of the length scale of the squared exponential kernel.\\n\\nConsidering that one of the motivations of the proposed approach is how prohibitive existing approaches are, having estimates of computational cost and/or runtime experiments could be a welcome addition to the paper.
